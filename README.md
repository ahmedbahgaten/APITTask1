This is a problem which states that , 
Imagine you have got a device which is basically a wheel that has the alphabetic english letters orderd sequentially,
and this device prints any text you want by rotating this wheel to reach each letter of the text , what we need to solve is to get 
the minimum number of rotation of this wheel to print the whole text 
#EX
if I want to let the wheel prints the word "ahmed" 
it has to start from "a" going to "h" then to "m" then to "e" and finally to "d"  , with minimum number of rotations 
so from a to h is x number of rotations 
and from h to m is y number of rotations 
and from m to e is z number of rotations 
and from e to d is i number of rotations 
what we need to know is (x+y+z+i) 
bearing in mind that if we want to move from  "a" to "z" we don't want to move 26 letters , rather we want to move one step back so the minimum number of rotations by then is "1" not "26"
